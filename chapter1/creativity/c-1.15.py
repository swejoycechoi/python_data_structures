'''Write a Python function that takes a sequence of numbers and determines
if all the numbers are different from each other (that is, they are distinct).'''

# Hint: The simple solution just checks each number against every other
# one, but we will discuss better solutions later in the book. But make sure
# you donâ€™t compare a number to itself
