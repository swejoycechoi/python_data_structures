'''Write a Python program that simulates a handheld calculator. Your program
should process input from the Python console representing buttons
that are “pushed,” and then output the contents of the screen after each operation
is performed. Minimally, your calculator should be able to process
the basic arithmetic operations and a reset/clear operation.'''

# Hint: Write your program to loop continually until a quit operation is
# entered. In each iteration, collect a sequence of button pushes, and then
# output the result from processing that sequence of pushes
