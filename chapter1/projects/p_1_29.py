'''Write a Python program that outputs all possible strings formed by using
the characters c , a , t , d , o , and g exactly once.'''

# Hint: There are many solutions. If you know about recursion, the
# easiest solution uses this technique. Otherwise, consider using a list to
# hold solutions. If this still seems to hard, then consider using six nested
# loops (but avoid repeating characters and make sure you allow all string
# lengths)
