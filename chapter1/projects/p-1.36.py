'''Write a Python program that inputs a list of words, separated by whitespace,
and outputs how many times each word appears in the list. You
need not worry about efficiency at this point, however, as this topic is
something that will be addressed later in this book.'''

# Hint: You need some way of telling when you have seen the same word
# you have before. Feel free to just search through your list of words to do this here
