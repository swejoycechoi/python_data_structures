'''A common punishment for school children is to write out a sentence multiple
times. Write a Python stand-alone program that will write out the
following sentence one hundred times: “I will never spam my friends
again.” Your program should number each of the sentences and it should
make eight different random-looking typos.'''

# Hint: Define a way of indexing all the sentences and the location in
# each one and then work out a way of picking eight of these locations for a typo
