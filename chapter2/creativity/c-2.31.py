'''Write a Python class that extends the Progression class so that each value
in the progression is the absolute value of the difference between the previous
two values. You should include a constructor that accepts a pair of
numbers as the first two values, using 2 and 200 as the defaults'''

# Hint: Model your solution after our other subclasses of Progression
