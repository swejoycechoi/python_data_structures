'''The PredatoryCreditCard class of Section 2.4.1 provides a process month
method that models the completion of a monthly cycle. Modify the class
so that once a customer has made ten calls to charge in the current month,
each additional call to that function results in an additional $1 surcharge'''


# Hint: The key is being able to accurately track how many times charge
# has been called thus far during a month
