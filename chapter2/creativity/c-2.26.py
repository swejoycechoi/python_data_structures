'''The SequenceIterator class of Section 2.3.4 provides what is known as a
forward iterator. Implement a class named ReversedSequenceIterator that
serves as a reverse iterator for any Python sequence type. The first call to
next should return the last element of the sequence, the second call to next
should return the second-to-last element, and so forth'''

# Hint: Think about how the internal counter should be initialized
