'''Write a set of Python classes that can simulate an Internet application in
which one party, Alice, is periodically creating a set of packets that she
wants to send to Bob. An Internet process is continually checking if Alice
has any packets to send, and if so, it delivers them to Bobâ€™s computer, and
Bob is periodically checking if his computer has a packet from Alice, and,
if so, he reads and deletes it'''

# Hint: Use three different classes, for each of the actors, and provide
# methods that perform their various tasks, as well as a simulator engine
# that performs the periodic operations
