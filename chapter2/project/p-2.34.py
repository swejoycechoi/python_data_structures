'''Write a Python program that inputs a document and then outputs a barchart
plot of the frequencies of each alphabet character that appears in
that document'''

# Hint: You don’t have to use GUI constructs; simple text output is sufficient, 
# say, using X’s to indicate the values to print for each bar 
# (and printing them sideways)
