'''Develop an inheritance hierarchy based upon a Polygon class that has
abstract methods area( ) and perimeter( ). Implement classes Triangle,
Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon that extend this base
class, with the obvious meanings for the area( ) and perimeter( ) methods.
Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle,
and Square, that have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally,
write a simple program that allows users to create polygons of the
various types and input their geometric dimensions, and the program then
outputs their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input
polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two
such polygons are similar'''

# Hint: Look up the formulas for area and perimeter on the Internet
