'''The collections.Sequence abstract base class does not provide support for
comparing two sequences to each other. Modify our Sequence class from
Code Fragment 2.14 to include a definition for the eq method, so
that expression seq1 == seq2 will return True precisely when the two
sequences are element by element equivalent'''

# Hint: Be especially careful when the two sequences do not have the same length
