'''Describe a component from a text-editor GUI and the methods that it encapsulates'''

# Hint: Consider the File or Window menus

'''The "File" menu in a text editor GUI encapsulates essential 
file management methods that provide users with the ability 
to create, open, save, print, and close documents, 
as well as exit the application. These methods ensure that 
the text editor remains user-friendly and functional, 
facilitating seamless document handling for the user.'''
