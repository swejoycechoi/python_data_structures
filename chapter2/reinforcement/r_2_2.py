'''Give an example of a software application in which adaptability can mean
the difference between a prolonged lifetime of sales and bankruptcy'''

# Hint: Consider an application that is expected to change over time, be-
# cause of changing economics, politics, or technology

'''Waymo (Google's self driving car project) exemplifies adaptability 
by consistently updating to meet evolving regulatory standards, 
integrating the latest tech, and addressing diverse 
environmental conditions. This ensures regulatory compliance. 
Without such adaptability, the software risks becoming obsolete, 
non-compliant, and less attractive to consumers, potentially leading to 
financial instability.
