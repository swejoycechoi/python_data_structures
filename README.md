## Introduction

This project provides the coded solutions to the exercises found in the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python." The solutions are implemented in Python and cover a wide range of topics including basic data structures, algorithm analysis, recursion, sorting, and more.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters as follows:

```
